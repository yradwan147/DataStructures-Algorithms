For task 0, the complexity is approximately O(1) since the length of calls and texts is irrelevant.
For task 1, the complexity is approximately O(n^2).
For task 2, the complexity is approximately O(n). Because there's only one loop in calls.
For task 3, the complexity is approximately O(nlog(n)). More specifically, worst case scenario would be O(3n)
For task 4, the complexity is approximately O(nlog(n)). More specifically, worst case scenario would be O(4n)
